            <p>
              In Project Zomboid, the player aims to survive for as long as
              possible in an apocalyptic and zombie-ridden area around the city
              of Louisville, Kentucky - referred to as 'Knox Country' - which
              has been quarantined by the government.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot
              houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their
              inevitable death day by day. No help is coming - their continued
              survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a
              relentless horde.
