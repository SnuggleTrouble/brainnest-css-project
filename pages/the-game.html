            In Project Zomboid, the player aims to survive for as long as
            possible in an apocalyptic and zombie-ridden area around the city of
            Louisville, Kentucky - referred to as 'Knox Country' - which has
            been quarantined by the government.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot
            houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable
            death day by day. No help is coming - their continued survival
            relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless
            horde.
